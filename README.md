🌟 AutoRia Clone Platform 🌟
Welcome to the AutoRia Clone platform — a scalable, modern solution for buying and selling cars. It’s designed to be highly flexible and ready for deployment to AWS with seamless scaling.
🔑 Key Features 🔑

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles
The platform supports four distinct user roles, each with different permissions:
Buyer: A user browsing the platform who can contact sellers or dealerships for test drives or viewings.
Seller: A user who wants to sell a car.
Manager: A user who moderates the platform (e.g., bans users or removes invalid listings).
Admin: A superuser with full access to all features. Only platform owners and partners will have this role.

Superuser Credentials for Instructor Testing
To verify the functionality of the platform, you can use the following superuser credentials to access the Django admin panel:
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: 11111

🛠️ Account Types
Basic Account: Default account for sellers. This allows posting a single car listing.
Premium Account: Grants unlimited listings and access to advanced statistics, such as views per day/week/month and regional price averages.

🚗 Core Features
Car Listings
Sellers can list cars with details such as the brand, model, price (in USD, EUR, UAH), and region.
Basic accounts: Limit to one car listing.
Premium accounts: Unlimited car listings.
Currency Conversion: Car prices are automatically converted using the PrivatBank exchange rate and updated daily.
If inappropriate words are found, sellers will be prompted to edit the listing (up to 3 attempts).
After 3 failed attempts, the listing becomes inactive and managers are notified.
Listing Statistics (Premium Only)
Premium users can view the following detailed statistics for their listings:
Views per day, week, and month.
Average car price by region (e.g., Kyiv, Lviv).
National average price for cars.

🏗️ System Architecture 🏗️
The system is designed for scalability and flexibility and Docker for containerization, for deployment AWS. The architecture consists of the following components:
Backend (Django): Handles car listings, user management, and statistics.
Frontend (Next.js): The user interface for browsing listings and managing accounts.
Database (MySQL): Stores all user and car listing data.
Redis: Used for caching and task management via Celery.
Celery: Asynchronous task execution.
Nginx: Reverse proxy managing incoming requests.

🛠️ Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/OksanaMosk/AutoRiaClone.git
cd AutoRiaClone

2. Install Backend Dependencies (Django)
Navigate to the backend directory and install Python dependencies:
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install Frontend Dependencies (Next.js)

cd backend
python manage.py migrate

5. Running Locally with Docker Compose
To run the application locally using Docker Compose:
docker-compose up --build
Backend (Django) will be available at http://localhost:8000//8888
Frontend (Next.js) will be available at http://localhost:3000

🐳 Docker Containers
This project includes the following Docker containers:
Backend (Django): For the API service.
Frontend (Next.js): For the user interface.
Database (MySQL): For storing data.
Redis: For task management.
Celery: For asynchronous background tasks.
Nginx: For serving static files and acting as a reverse proxy.
To build and run the containers locally:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

☁️ AWS Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk)
For deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the project included a Dockerrun.aws.json file for multi-container Docker deployments.
Unfortunately, I was not able to fully complete the deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
I used Dockerrun.aws.json ![Dockerrun](./screenshots/dockerrun.jpg), Gunicorn, and a ZIP archive for deployment, and also set up an RDS MariaDB instance.
According to the system logs, no critical errors were reported.
However, the Next.js client page did not render correctly, and only the default Elastic Beanstalk welcome page was displayed.
Relevant screenshots are attached.

![AWS page](./screenshots/awspage.jpg)
After approximately 50 deployment attempts, and due to limited time and unstable electricity supply, I decided to revert the deployment configuration to a local build setup in order to ensure that the project could be properly reviewed and tested locally.
I would really appreciate it if you could take into account the considerable effort and time I invested in attempting to deploy the project to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
I will continue trying to successfully deploy the project to AWS Elastic Beanstalk in the future.
